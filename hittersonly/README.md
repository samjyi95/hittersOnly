# HittersOnly 

This project was started by Sam Yi in response of making a better and more efficient way of ananlyzing baseball analytics pertaining specifically batters.

## About

This app dive deep into baseball analytics. So buckle up and get ready to dive deep into all kinds of data.
We've taken steps to account for EVERY possible scenario a batter can face. Everything from what base has runners, how many outs there and even the batter count. With all these factors in place, the software functionality can provide batting a general BA (Batting Average) as well as a SBA (Specified Batting Average) based on the environment and the scenario the current batter is. 

This tool can be used to analyze patterns that you or your batter faces, from there you gain statistical insight to how you or your batter can become better. Ultimately you know where the weak spots are and you can specifically aim to improve in those areas.



## Technologies Used

This is a React based app that uses Javascript on the front-end and MySQL on the Backend
Other Frameworks are still TBD as we explore our options and see what is best for the creation of this app as it continues to be developed over time.
